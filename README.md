# Restaurant managing system

## Tasks

Write one of the main backend classes along with its parameters, setters and getters.

> **_Ahmed_: Order class**  
  **_AbdElRahman_: Table class**  
  **_Zeyad_: Item class**  
  **_Hisham_: Payment class**

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Package Structure

We will divide the code structure into 2 main components:
- Frontend package
- Backend package

### Frontend package

This will contain the main class and all of the GUI components of the program.

### Backend package

This will contain the backend classes and interfaces of the program.

> _**Note: For child classes of a specific parent class we will define a subpackage with the name of the parent class and put all of the child classes in this package.**_ (This will require importing the parent class to each child class)

## Ideas

- We can track the stats of the Items such as preparation time and customer ratings.
- _feel free to put your ideas in here so we can discuss them in the next meeting..._
